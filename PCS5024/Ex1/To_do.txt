Practice: Classifiers for the Adult Dataset
To be handed until May 15 in edisciplinas: a write-up, two pages long at most, in pdf format, describing the results obtained in the following task:

1) Get the dataset Adult (either in the UCI Repository or in Kaggle).

2) Analyze features, missing data, and overall characteristics of the dataset (using tools in sklearn). Select features, discretize numerical features, handle missing data. 

3) Build a kNN classifier to predict class variable ">50k" (that is, whether person gets more than US$50k/year or not). Select the hyperparameter using cross-validation; test the final classifier using a holdout dataset.

4) Repeat (3) using either a classification tree or a random forest.

5) Present accuracy, precision and recall for the best classifier in (3) and in (4).

6) Extra points: repeat (3) using a Multi-Layer Perceptron.
